"""Search-R1 generate function — drift-aware variant (chat-template based).

Built on top of generate_with_search_tools_qwen_sft.py. Goal: minimize the
gap between the token sequence the model actually saw at rollout time
(sglang's prefill of turn N+1 sees the result of turn-by-turn-tokenized
text) and the token sequence the optimizer trains on
(`prompt_token_ids + response_token_ids`).

The four drift sources from the audit are addressed here:

1. Chat-template alignment.
   The original script let sglang stop on `</tool_call>`/`</answer>` and
   never appended `<|im_end|>` between assistant and the next user
   tool_response. Training, on the other hand, injected `<|im_end|>` after
   every model turn with `loss_mask=1`, training the model on a token it
   never produced and shifting every subsequent observation token by 1.

   This file delegates ALL conversation wrapping to the upstream
   `tokenizer.apply_chat_template` (Qwen3 default). Glue between turns
   (`<|im_end|>\n`, `<|im_start|>user\n<tool_response>...`,
   `<|im_start|>assistant\n`) gets `loss_mask = 0` and a placeholder
   `rollout_log_prob = 0.0`.

   Caveat: Qwen3's default template re-renders the `<think>...</think>`
   block in canonical form (`<think>\n{R}\n</think>\n\n{C}`). When the
   model already emits canonical format — which is the expectation for a
   model SFT'd on Qwen3 thinking format and conditioned on a properly-
   rendered multi-turn history — re-rendering is a no-op and sglang's
   tokens line up exactly with the rendered text. When the model deviates
   (rare: truncation, parse-failure turns without `</think>`, etc.) the
   incremental render in `build_training_data` detects it via a
   startswith check and falls back to `loss_mask=0` for that whole turn,
   so the IS ratio for downstream turns stays clean. The count of such
   turns is surfaced via `sample.metadata["template_drift_turns"]`.

2. Context window / rolling compression removed.
   Search results are always rendered in full.

3. Decode -> encode self-consistency check.
   At the end of `build_training_data` we decode `prompt_token_ids +
   response_token_ids` to text and re-encode it. If BPE re-merges anywhere
   we surface it via `sample.metadata["bpe_drift"]`.

4. TIS wrapper (`compute_mis_weights_with_cp_no_drift`).
   Defense-in-depth: any position whose `rollout_log_prob == 0.0` is
   forced to mask = 0 before invoking the standard TIS function.

    prompt) is delegated to the upstream `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`
    (Qwen3 default — no custom Jinja).

    Historical-think compression (Qwen3 multi-turn convention)
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    Qwen3's default template normally strips `<think>...</think>` from
    every assistant turn whose index is < `last_query_index` (i.e. before
    the last *real* user query). In search-R1 multi-turn rollouts the
    only real user message is the original question — every subsequent
    user is a `<tool_response>` wrapper which the template explicitly
    excludes from `last_query_index`. Consequence: with the unmodified
    pipeline ALL prior assistants kept their think blocks, the rollout
    context grew turn-over-turn, and the 4k generation budget started
    being eaten by re-prefilled past thinks instead of new tokens.

    Fix: in `_materialized_messages` we manually strip `<think>...</think>`
    from non-trained assistant turns, and the chat template renders them
    as plain content (no canonical-think wrapper). The flag
    `keep_last_think` selects which turn keeps its think:

      * `False` — rollout (sglang prefill view). Every entry in
        `self.turns` is in the past, so all of them are stripped.
      * `True`  — training view. The LAST turn is the one we train on,
        so its think is preserved (sglang generated those think tokens
        and we want to credit-assign them).

    Past-turn gradient (IS-biased): stripping past thinks changes the KV
    context the historical tool_call tokens were generated under, so the
    rollout/train log-prob ratio is no longer a clean IS weight. We
    accept that bias and still train on past tool_calls (matching
    tau-bench's `_build_training_tensor` design): for each past turn,
    case (b) below sets `loss_mask=1` on the post-`</think>` tail of
    sglang's sampled tokens and uses the corresponding post-think slice
    of sampled log-probs as `rollout_log_prob`. The trade-off: gradient
    signal on every well-aligned turn at the price of biased IS weights
    on past tool_calls. The LAST turn's think is preserved so its body
    aligns 1:1 with sglang (case a, unbiased). The TIS wrapper at the
    bottom of this file additionally masks any position whose
    `rollout_log_prob == 0.0` (context glue / drift) as defense in depth.

    Drift handling for `</think>` reformatting of the trained turn
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Qwen3's template re-emits the LAST assistant's think as canonical
    `<think>\n{R}\n</think>\n\n{C}`. When the model already produces
    canonical format the re-emit is a no-op and sglang's tokens line up
    with the rendered text. When it doesn't (rare: truncation, a turn
    without `</think>`), the startswith check in `build_training_data`
    falls back to `loss_mask=0` for the whole last turn rather than
    feeding mis-aligned tokens to the optimizer. Counter is exposed via
    `template_drift_turns`.

        Why the three-case aligner was removed
        --------------------------------------
        The previous implementation rebuilt the trained sequence by rendering
        the whole conversation back to text via ``apply_chat_template`` and
        re-tokenizing it, then demanded the re-tokenized assistant span equal
        sglang's streamed ids per turn (cases a/b) or else zeroed the WHOLE
        turn (case c). Three template/tokenizer divergences broke that match
        on most turns:

          * the Qwen3 template INJECTS an empty ``<think>\\n\\n</think>\\n\\n``
            before the LAST assistant turn when the model didn't emit a
            ``<think>`` (60-77% of turns), so the rendered span carried tokens
            sglang never produced;
          * ``<think>`` canonicalization of non-canonical spacing;
          * BPE boundary re-merges between rendered text and the stream.

        Result: 50-64% of samples ended fully masked (median trainable tokens
        == 0); the policy gradient saw almost none of its own behaviour and
        raw_reward drifted *down*.

        The fix
        -------
        The assistant body of every turn is taken VERBATIM from sglang's
        streamed token ids (``turn["model_token_ids"]``) with ``loss_mask=1``
        and the streamed ``model_log_probs`` as ``rollout_log_prob`` — the
        trained tokens ARE exactly the tokens sglang generated, so the IS
        ratio numerator/denominator refer to the same token. Everything
        between turns (the trailing ``<|im_end|>``, the
        ``<|im_start|>user\\n<tool_response>...</tool_response><|im_end|>\\n``
        block, and the next ``<|im_start|>assistant\\n``) is fixed glue,
        tokenized in isolation, with ``loss_mask=0`` / ``rollout_log_prob=0.0``.
        Every glue boundary marker is an atomic added special token
        (id >= 151644), so isolated tokenization is byte-identical to what
        sglang prefilled — no new drift is introduced.

        ``prompt_token_ids`` already ends with ``<|im_start|>assistant\\n``
        (the generation prompt), so turn 0's body concatenates directly onto
        it; no leading assistant-open glue precedes turn 0.

        strip_think faithfulness
        ------------------------
        With ``strip_think`` ON, sglang prefilled turn i+1 over PAST
        assistants whose ``<think>`` was stripped, so past-turn bodies are
        sliced to their post-``</think>`` tail (same slice the old case (b)
        computed) to keep the trained prefix faithful; the LAST/trained turn
        always uses its full streamed body. With ``strip_think`` OFF
        (recommended) every turn uses its full body and the concatenation is
        byte-exact to sglang's prefill — no IS bias on any turn.

        The trailing ``<|im_end|>`` of each turn is emitted with
        ``loss_mask=0`` / ``rollout_log_prob=0.0``: sglang stops on
        ``</tool_call>``/``</answer>`` and does not itself generate
        ``<|im_end|>``, and the no_drift TIS wrapper force-masks any position
        whose rollout_log_prob == 0.0 anyway, so marking it trainable would be
        a silent inconsistency.

# Eval generate wrapper — search rollout that ALSO assigns the task reward.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why this exists (OPD eval). For a normal search-R1 RL run the launch script
# sets `--custom-rm-path generate_with_search_tools_qwen_sft_no_drift.reward_func`,
# so `generate_and_rm` (in sglang_rollout.py) computes the EM task score via
# `async_rm` for both training rollouts and eval. On-policy distillation runs
# instead point `--custom-rm-path` at the teacher reward
# (`slime.rollout.on_policy_distillation.reward_func`, which returns teacher
# token logprobs / a 0.0 task reward). Because `async_rm` ALWAYS prefers
# `args.custom_rm_path` when it is set, eval in an OPD run would otherwise score
# every trajectory with the teacher reward (and need the teacher server up at
# eval time) — useless as a task-accuracy metric.
#
# `generate_and_rm` only calls `async_rm` when `sample.reward is None`. So this
# wrapper runs the ordinary search rollout via `generate(...)` and then fills in
# `sample.reward` with the real EM score from `reward_func(...)`. With the reward
# already set, `async_rm` (and therefore the OPD teacher reward) is skipped, and
# eval reports genuine search task accuracy without contacting the teacher.
#
# Wire it ONLY for eval via the eval dataset config's
# `custom_generate_function_path` (see examples/on_policy_distillation/
# eval_search.yaml); training rollout keeps using the plain `generate`.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TIS wrapper — drift fix #4.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `compute_mis_weights_with_cp_no_drift` wraps the standard TIS function and
# zeros out any position whose `rollout_log_prob == 0.0`. Those are by
# construction the system-injected glue tokens (we set them to 0.0 in
# `build_training_data`); even though `loss_mask` is already 0 there, this
# wrapper guards against:
#   - upstream code paths that re-derive a loss_mask of all 1s,
#   - any future change to add_turn / build_training_data that forgets to
#     keep loss_mask aligned with rollout_log_probs.
#
# CP-correctness:
#   `loss_masks` arrives from the caller as FULL-length response masks,
#   while `rollout_log_probs` and `train_log_probs` arrive CP-SLICED
#   (see actor.py:_get_rollout_data + slice_log_prob_with_cp). Element-
#   wise masking on the raw inputs would shape-mismatch under CP > 1.
#   The fix: gather rollout_log_probs to full length BEFORE building the
#   masked loss_masks, then hand the (already-masked) loss_masks plus the
#   ORIGINAL CP-sliced log-probs to the upstream wrapper, which does its
#   own all_gather internally. This double-gather is cheap relative to
#   forward/backward and keeps the wrapper purely additive.
#
# Wire it via the script:
#   --custom-tis-function-path \
#     generate_with_search_tools_qwen_sft_no_drift.compute_mis_weights_with_cp_no_drift
# (PYTHONPATH already contains the search-r1 directory, see the launch
# script.)
